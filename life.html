      <p>Do the effort of changing whatever you feel is not part of your life. The pursuit of your own happiness should be your main goal in life. Of course, I am not suggesting you to to be selfish and not to think about the people who love you. But, there is a way in between living the life you are 'supposed' to live, and live the life you want to live.</p>
