      <p>I know that it is easier to say it, but if you find yourself bored with your 9 to 5 job, why don't you look for something better? Working for a company that you don't like will not be that bad if you know that it is only temporary. However, if you just wait for the time to pass by, you will hate it more and more, day by day. You career is in your own happiness, as well as your life.</p>
